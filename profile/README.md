## Hi there 👋

As a collaborative effort, together with the [Energy Networks Association (ENA)](https://www.energynetworks.org/), our purpose is to provide a place for people from the energy sector to work on projects that will benefit the industry as a whole.

Please read the [Terms of Reference v1](https://github.com/Energy-Data-Science-Collaboration-Forum/.github/blob/main/Energy%20Data%20Science%20Collaboration%20Forum%20Terms%20of%20Reference%20v1.pdf) if you would like to collaborate with us.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
